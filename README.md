# Beginners-Lists
Beginner's Problems based on Python Lists. 

**Starter:**
Biggest, Smallest and Average
Here’s a list of numbers: 
numsList = [7, 6, 23, 8.18, 18, 8, 7.2, 85, 915, 12]

Output the biggest number, the smallest number and the average of all the numbers. 
For the biggest and smallest numbers, also output the position they are at in the list. 

**Same Start and End:**
Here’s a list of strings:
stringsList = [“abc”, “123”, “2332”, “aBBA”, “heelloo”, “1212”, “DcEfD”]

Output the number of strings that have the same character at the start and end. 
In this problem, ‘A’ and ‘a’ are the same characters (technically)

*Hint: strings are a list of characters.*

**List of (good) Cereals**
Allow the user to input a cereal. 
If the cereal is not ‘sultana and bran’ or ‘weetbix’, then add the cereal to a list called ‘cerealList’. (Doesn’t matter if there’s double-ups of cereal)
Once the user inputs any of the very much hated cereals, end the program and output cerealList.

Input Example
<br />
Enter Cereal: Cheerios <br />
Enter Cereal: Nutri Grain <br />
Enter Cereal: Cinnamon Toast Crunch <br />
Enter Cereal: Corn Flakes <br />
Enter Cereal: Weetbix <br />
Output Example<br />
[‘Cheerios’, ‘Nutri Grain’, ‘Cinnamon Toast Crunch’, ‘Corn Flakes’]
