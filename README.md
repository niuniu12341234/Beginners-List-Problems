# Beginners-Lists
Beginner's Problems based on Python Lists. 

**Starter:**
Biggest, Smallest and Average
Here’s a list of numbers: 
numsList = [7, 6, 23, 8.18, 18, 8, 7.2, 85, 915, 12]

Output the biggest number, the smallest number and the average of all the numbers. 
For the biggest and smallest numbers, also output the position they are at in the list. 

**Same Start and End:**
Here’s a list of strings:
stringsList = [“abc”, “123”, “2332”, “aBBA”, “heelloo”, “1212”, “DcEfD”]

Output the number of strings that have the same character at the start and end. 
In this problem, ‘A’ and ‘a’ are the same characters (technically)

*Hint: strings are a list of characters.*

**I Like Pesto (a lot):**
8 people have decided to let you know what their favourite food is. 
You will ask each of them what their favourite food is and if their favourite food is ‘pesto’ add it to a list called ‘iLikePesto’. 
If it’s a different food, add it to a list called ‘otherFoods’. 
Print the number of ‘pesto’ mentioned in iLikePesto, print ‘I like pesto’ for that number of times and print the list of the other foods. 
<br /> 
*Input Example*
<br />
What’s your favourite food? Pesto<br />
What’s your favourite food? Chicken<br />

**List of (good) Cereals:**
Allow the user to input a cereal. 
If the cereal is not ‘sultana and bran’ or ‘weetbix’, then add the cereal to a list called ‘cerealList’. (Doesn’t matter if there’s double-ups of cereal)
Once the user inputs any of the very much hated cereals, end the program and output cerealList. 
<br /> 
*Input Example*
<br />
Enter Cereal: Cheerios <br />
Enter Cereal: Nutri Grain <br />
Enter Cereal: Cinnamon Toast Crunch <br />
Enter Cereal: Corn Flakes <br />
Enter Cereal: Weetbix <br />
<br />
